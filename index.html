<h2>Description of the project </h2>
For our first year at the Design and Development of videogames degree in the Project 1 subject we had to replicate some classical fighting videogames. We chose Fatal Fury: King of fighters.
<h3> Samurai Shodown </h3>
Fatal Fury King of fighters is a fighting videogame developed and published by SNK originally in 1991 for SNK's NEO GEO arcade machine MVS and not too much later for the home console version. This game has a lot of versions and sequels but we tried to replicate the original one.
